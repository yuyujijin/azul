# Azul, the board game


## What is Azul ?

Azul is a strategic board game made for young people (from age of 8). It can be played with 2,3 or 4 players. 


## How does Azul works ?

Each player has a board, with patterns to complete with tiles, picked from different part of the board.
There are 5 different colors for the tiles. Each players must place the tiles in a pattern line, and then on a wall (the main board). The game is composed of rounds.
The game ends when a player's wall line is full.
Then, there is a counting for the score, and the players with the best score wins the game.


## How Azul is supposed to be used ?

Just compile the Launcher.java file (javac Launcher.java), in Clisson-Valty/Code/Java, and then run the java file (java Launcher ).


## File format

The data of Azul is stored in human-readable text files. Thoses files are written in java. The files are stored in a git repository.
There are also images stored in a specitif folder, used for the graphic interface.
